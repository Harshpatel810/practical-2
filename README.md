Demonstrate the usage of React props to pass data from a parent component (App) to a child component (UserProfile).

The parent component stores information about a user, such as their name, age, location, and bio, in a JavaScript object.

This data is then passed down to the UserProfile component as individual props.

The UserProfile component receives these props and displays the user's information in a structured format.
